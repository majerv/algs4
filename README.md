Algorithms, Part I course on Coursera

Here you can find my solutions given for programming assignments those were available during the course.

**WARNING**: This repo serves only as a backup in any case of data loss. Do not use it to fulfill your assignments, and please always abide by the Coursera [honor code](https://www.coursera.org/maestro/auth/normal/tos.php#honorcode).

**Disclaimer**: the codes in this repo only use libraries that the coursera assesments accepted (in real life these problems would be solved by using 3rd party libraries to make them simpler)
